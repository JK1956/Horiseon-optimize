# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Descripton
The following project is a code refactor of the homepage of the Horiseon website. The purposes for refactoring are to optimize the previous code for efficiency, accessibility and search engine optimization. The styling of the deployed page has not been modified and all code changes were made with this in mind. The current deployed webpage was designed to render properly at screen widths of 1024px and above.

### Issues Resolved
* Standard div HTML elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements for SEO
* Consolidation of redundant classes for efficiency
* Addition of alt text to images
* Addition of comments to explain code for future use
* Addition of descriptive title and shortcut icon
* Logical restructuring of HTML/CSS styling elements and selectors

## Screenshots of deployed page

The website homepage will appear as the following once deployed in a traditonal desktop browser:

The website homepage will appear as the following once deployed in a desktop browser with a width of 1024px:

## Usage
